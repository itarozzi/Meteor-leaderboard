Meteor Leaderboard application
=====================================

Just a simple application to learn how to use the [Meteor framework](https://www.meteor.com/).

This application is described in the book "Your First Meteor Application. A Complete Beginner's Guide to Meteor.js" by David Turnbull.

You can find the original github project in the github page of the author: [David on GitHub](https://github.com/davidturnbull)


I pushed a git commit for each chapter, so you can see the evolution of the app walking to the commits tree.


I used VSCode as editor, with Meteor plugins.
